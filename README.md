# lib

## Getting started

```bash
# Install the required dependencies
yarn
```

## Testing

Bug fixes and features should always come with tests, when applicable. Test files should live next to the file they are testing. Before submitting your changes in a pull request, always run the full test suite.

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Runs the full test suite
yarn test

# Runs the full w/ the watch flag and coverage reports
yarn test:dev
```

**Helpful Testing Process**

One technique that can helpful when writing tests, is to reference the coverage report for the file/function/feature you're testing. To do this, run `yarn test:dev` from your terminal. This will generate a coverage report for the project. The `coverage` directory will be located in the root directory. There is an `index.html` which shows the coverage report per file.
